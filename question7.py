_Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row 
and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.*
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
